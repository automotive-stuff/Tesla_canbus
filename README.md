# Tesla_canbus
The goal with this project is to display filtered canbus data on the built-in center console of Tesla Model S & X.

This is a work in progress and will be updated several times until completion. 

I'm using a Raspberry pi 4 and a PICAN2 card and connecting it to Can3

Principles of operation.
